Publications Using Scenic
=========================

Main Papers
-----------

The main paper on Scenic is:

	| :t:`Scenic: A Language for Scenario Specification and Scene Generation`.
	| Fremont, Dreossi, Ghosh, Yue, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and Seshia.
	| PLDI 2019. [`full version <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09310>`_]
	| (see also the `extended preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06580>`_ on Scenic 2.0)

An expanded version of this paper appears as Chapters 5 and 8 of this thesis:

	| :t:`Algorithmic Improvisation`. [`thesis <https://people.ucsc.edu/~dfremont/papers/thesis.pdf>`__]
	| Daniel J. Fremont.
	| Ph.D. dissertation, 2019 (University of California, Berkeley; Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science).

Scenic is also integrated into the `VerifAI toolkit <https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/VerifAI>`_, which is described in another paper:

	| :t:`VerifAI: A Toolkit for the Formal Design and Analysis of Artificial Intelligence-Based Systems`.
	| Dreossi*, Fremont*, Ghosh*, Kim, Ravanbakhsh, Vazquez-Chanlatte, and Seshia.
	| `CAV 2019 <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25540-4_25>`_.

\* Equal contribution.


Case Studies
------------

We have also used Scenic in several industrial case studies:

	| :t:`Formal Analysis and Redesign of a Neural Network-Based Aircraft Taxiing System with VerifAI`.
	| Fremont, Chiu, Margineantu, Osipychev, and Seshia.
	| `CAV 2020 <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/pubs/b2hd-fremont-cav20.html>`_.

	.. _ITSC2020:

	| :t:`Formal Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles: From Simulation to the Real World`.
	| Fremont, Kim, Pant, Seshia, Acharya, Bruso, Wells, Lemke, Lu, and Mehta.
	| `ITSC 2020 <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/pubs/b2hd-fremont-itsc20.html>`_.
